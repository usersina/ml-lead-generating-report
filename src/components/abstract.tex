\section*{Abstract}
This report explores the application of machine learning techniques to enhance lead generation processes for a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform. In a landscape where businesses increasingly rely on digital platforms and social networks, the need for effective lead engagement strategies becomes paramount. The project journey involves data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and practical implementation. Key findings showcase the successful deployment of a recommendation system, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the way businesses tailor messages to leads. Lessons learned from challenges encountered during the project pave the way for future refinements. This academic endeavor marks a great opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired throughout the Machine Learning course at IT Business School.
