\section*{General Conclusion}

Throughout the course of this project, we have been able to build a solid proof of concept for a recommendation system that can be used to recommend
existing messages to leads in order to increase the conversion rate.
The realization of this project was a great opportunity to learn about the different aspects of building such a system, from data collection to model deployment.

To successfully finalize this project, a lot of sacrifices had to be made, mainly sleep and social life.
That said, we would like to improve the model by adding more features and using a more targeted algorithm.
We would also like to improve the data collection process by automating it and making it more robust.
Additionally, one very good additional would be to add another model that uses Natural Language Processing to generate entirely new messages.
Finally, we would like to deploy the model to a production server and integrate it into the company's SaaS software using various CI/CD tools and techniques.
